i am torn  
torn about purpose and fulfillment   
between wanting me to know me  
and everyone, me  
  
torn about a deeper meaning  
a larger cause, a greater feeling  
torn about passion, contribution  
and leaving a legacy behind  

and as a get older, the tear only widens  
while i wait, wait for its healing  

but am i not just a speck in this galaxy?  
what do i even owe it

Arcane is one of those shows that you can pretty much keep rewatching and still discover new things. The visuals are mind-blowing. Just. Look. At. These. WOW! [Credits: This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qwhrvn/100_4k_upscaled_stills_from_arcane_so_far_spoilers/)

The music is top! It has a vibrant, pop-inspired vibe that instantly hooks you in. What makes it even more special is how it evokes vivid imagery from the show. Listening to it feels like being transported back into its world, with scenes and emotions replaying in my mind.  

What really makes Arcane special for me however are the quotes. While watching the show I noted a few down, but surely I missed some (I am a distracted individual). So to fill in the gaps, I turned to my trusty AI companions (using Llama 3.3 405B and Gemini Flash 2.0). I fed them the transcripts from all 18 episodes and asked them to extract 100 standout quotes. From that list, I carefully curated my top 20 favorites (absolute favorites first):

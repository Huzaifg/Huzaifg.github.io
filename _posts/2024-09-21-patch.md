tears heal,  
time forms patches, leaving a beautiful mark  
both subtle and deep.  

i remember vaguely being torn,  
torn about the selfâ€™s purpose and the self,  
whether i should solve the inward problems or the outwards.  
  
but then,   
when i started looking inwards,   
i found nothing outwards.  
when the inward problems were solved,   
no problems remained outwards  
  
time formed a patch,   
over my tear and my eyes,  
emotional and perceptual.  
  
the patch healed me,  
and made the entire world a better place.

I am Huzaifa, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin Madison. My academic interests are tied to simulation in robotics. For my Masters I worked on simulation tools for wheeled robots. Currently, I work on the modeling the terrain on which these wheeled-robots move! Read more about my work in [publications]({% link publications.md %}).  
In my free time I love watching and playing all kinds of sports. I love board games and am down for a game of [Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan) anytime. I love traveling and enjoy hiking hills and mountains.

I am Huzaifa, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin Madison. My academic interests are tied to simulation in robotics. For my Masters I worked on GPU accelerated [simulation tools for wheeled-vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443432). Currently, I work on the modeling the terrain with which robots interact! Read more about my work in [Publications](/publications/).  
In my free time I love watching and playing all kinds of sports. I love board games and am down for a game of [Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan) anytime. I love traveling and enjoy hiking hills and mountains.

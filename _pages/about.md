I am Huzaifa, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin Madison. My academic interests are tied to simulation in robotics. For my Masters I worked on GPU accelerated [simulation tools for wheeled-vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443432). For my PhD, I aim to democratize simulation of robots with fluids and granular material. I am part of the Project Chrono's Fluid Structure Interaction team and am working on GPU-optimizing the solver to enable simulation at interactive rates. Read more about my work at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JVf2x_gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).   
I write about SPH, Granular Material dynamics, and GPU-accelerated simulation in my [blog](/blog/).  

In my free time I love watching and playing sports. I love board games and am down for a game of [Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan) or [Azul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azul_(board_game)) at anytime before 11 PM. I love traveling and enjoy hiking hills and mountains - although not when it's too hot :)

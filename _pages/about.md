I am Huzaifa, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin Madison. My academic interests are tied to simulation in robotics. For my Masters I worked on GPU accelerated [simulation tools for wheeled-vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443432). Currently, I work on the modeling the terrain with which robots interact! For my PhD, I am particularly interested in how we can enable robots that dig and move granular material to train completely in simulation, with the help of fast and accurate models for terrains. Read more about my work in [Publications](/publications/).  
In my free time I love watching and playing all kinds of sports. I love board games and am down for a game of [Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan) or [Azul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azul_(board_game)) at anytime. I love traveling and enjoy hiking hills and mountains - although not when it's too hot :)
